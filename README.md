LowRez Tanks
============

This is my first entry into a game jam; a tank-based game created as part of
[LowRez Jam 2020](https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2020).

After struggling with ideas, I've started exploring the concept of being in a
tank with no means of propulsion except the recoil of your gun. 

The world will (eventually) be a maze you can bounce around, with a rudimentary
enemy 'radar' formed by a single pixel colour border.
